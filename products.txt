- mushrooms
Sustainably farmed on compost, mushrooms make the ultimate recyclers. Using leftover cotton hulls, almond husks, corn cobs, and saw dust, mushrooms sold on La Hacienda make use of the materials left over in the agriculture industry.
   - portabella xx
Dense and rich, this large mushroom makes a wonderful meat substitute. Their firm texture can withstand grilling and stuffing making them a great appetizer, or main course.
   - white button xx
With a mild taste and soft texture, the button mushroom should be a staple in all pantries. Its neutral-leaning flavor makes a wonderful inclusion to pizzas, soups, and stir-fry.
   - cremini xx
A younger portabella, this mushroom has a darker, firmer and more robust flavor. It can be used interchangeable with its lighter cousin, the button mushroom. Great addition to hearty sauces and meat dishes.
   - poplar xx
Often sold dried in many Asian stores, this nutty and crunchy mushroom gives hot pots and stews an additional depth in flavor and texture.
   - king trumpet xx
The bigger and meatier cousin of the oyster mushroom. When cooked, its stem lends a rich umami flavor and meaty texture. Great in saucy stir-fries as it soaks up stronger flavors like garlic or say sauce.
   - shiitake xx
Their distinct woody aroma reminds diners of its oriental roots. Fresh versions go great in stir fries while dried versions, when reconstituted, give an intense, full-bodied flavor profile to soups.
   - oyster xx
Coming in a variety of colors, but mostly as pale white, these delicate mushrooms lend a briny flavor and lacelike texture to most dishes. Commonly accompanies saucy Japanese and Chinese stir-fries.
   - enoki xx
These tiny white long-stemmed mushrooms lends a crunchy texture when raw. Perfect as a stuffing  in heartier proteins, such as chicken thighs or bacon.
   - porcini x
